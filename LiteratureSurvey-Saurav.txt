1.Microsoft Health Vault

Microsoft HealthVault was a web-based system for recording, storing, 
and maintaining digitised health information. Healthcare professionals
and individuals could both use the service. 

HealthVault was set up to let users collect their own personal healthcare information

Who Could Use HealthVault?

HealthVault was designed for individuals and healthcare professionals. 
As well as being able to access their own health records, parents could also manage their child’s records.


What Went Wrong With HealthVault?

As smartphones and wearable devices grew in popularity, HealthVault remained a largely browser-based experience without a mobile app. 
With no app,HealthVault missed the opportunity to gather telemetry data, information on health habits, and other user-generated input. 

Medical data in this format has limited use. These records were helpful for making insurance claims and for organisations processing 
healthcare billing but largely missed opportunities to add meaningful value in driving change in users’ health and wellbeing.
